# NOAAmp - Reliable Signal Gain for NOAA Reception
## By: @Scooter Y
### What it is?
NOAAmp is an extremely small PCB- only 28.5x20mm in size, that is capable of taking in an SMA input signal from an antenna like a QFH antenna, and amplifing the signal to be sent to a device like a RTL-SDR to be viewed. This PCB will **only work for 137MHZ** since that is the freq of the NOAA-19 satellite that I am targeting. 

### Progress
This PCB is done, but you can view my journal throughout on JOURNAL.md.
